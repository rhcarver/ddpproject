# ddpproject
Course project for Developing Data Products
This is a Shiny app that allows a user to dynamically view a list of US breakfast cereals filtered by the fat and sugar content in a single serving. 
The cereal data comes from pacakage MASS (UScereal) and some supporting facts for computations come from the USDA website:
  https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/how-many-calories-are-one-gram-fat-carbohydrate-or-protein

The Shiny app consists of this GitHub repo with 2 main files:
* ui.R -- user interface
* server.R -- the engine 

Finally, there is a 5-slide promotional pitch on RPubs at http://rpubs.com/rhcarver/203185
